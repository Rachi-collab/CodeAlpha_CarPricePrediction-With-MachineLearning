# CodeAlpha_CarPricePrediction-With-MachineLearning
This project, built during my CodeAlpha Data Science Internship, uses regression models to predict car prices based on features like brand value, horsepower, and mileage. It covers data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation using Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib).
